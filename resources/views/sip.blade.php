                    <div class="description">
                        <p>SIP means the Session Initiation Protocol.&nbsp; In IP and traditional telephony, network engineers have always made a clear distinction between two different phases of a voice call. The first phase is “call setup” and includes all of the details needed to get two telephones talking.&nbsp; Once the call has been set up, the phones enter a “data transfer” phase of the call using an entirely different family of protocols to actually move the voice packets between the two phones.&nbsp; In the world of VoIP, SIP is a call setup protocol that operates at the application layer.&nbsp; You may have also heard of H.323, an ITU protocol with similar function. They are fast becoming the standard technology that allows businesses to make and receive telephone calls without the need for an expensive ISDN circuit. SIP is used nowadays to set-up and ‘tear-down’ telephone calls over IP networks, including the internet. The VoIP protocol is most widely supported by modern devices, including IP-enabled PBXs and has a vast connection capacity worldwide.</p>

                        <p>We all are in need of urgency to stay connected into business. So, having a separate voice &amp; data networks is a legacy from the technology that was used only for voice communication before. We all know how data connectivity has grown to provide huge amounts of throughput for everyday communication.As the withdrawal of ISDN has been announced, voice networks move more and more towards SIP. <strong>SIP</strong> is used for signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions in applications of Internet telephony for voice and video calls, in private IP telephone systems, in instant messaging over Internet Protocol (IP) networks as well as mobile phone calling over LTE (VoLTE). So that you can get the voice data more clear and communication becomes as flexible as possible.</p>
